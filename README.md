# This is the repo for my coursework whilst on the John Hopkins University's Data Science Specialisation on Coursera.
## My aim is to transit from a career in quantitative geoscience (Applied Geophysics) to one in Data Science.
### I am looking forward to the opportunity of applying good problem-solving and analysis skills to selecting and addressing the right research questions, when:
* designing data science projects;
* obtaining and manipulating data sets; and
* creating visualisations and communicating research results.

## Courses in this specialisation include:
1. The Data Scientistâ€™s Toolbox
2. R Programming
3. Getting and Cleaning Data
4. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
5. Reproducible Research
6. Statistical Inference
7. Regression Models
8. Practical Machine Learning
9. Developing Data Products
10. Data Science Capstone

## The main tool used in this specialisation is the high-level statistical R programming language, its numerous packages and the RStudio integrated development environment (IDE).
*Note that these are all Free and Open Source Software (FOSS).*
